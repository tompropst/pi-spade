# The Pi Spade

The Pi Spade is an adapter board designed to make it easier to attach a Raspberry Pi Zero to a breadboard. Generically, it can be used to adapt any 2x20 header to a breadboard by spacing each 20-pin row around the breadboard center.

Here is the basic layout.

## Assembly

Three separate headers are required to assemble the Pi Spade. Links are for convenience only. There are many variants to choose from.

* [1x20 male pin header](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/adam-tech/PH1-20-UA/2057-PH1-20-UA-ND/9830398)
	- This is the set of pins that mirror one side of the Pi header across the center of the breadboard.
* [1x20 socket header](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/sullins-connector-solutions/PPTC201LFBN-RC/S7018-ND/810158)
	- This is the side of the Pi header that is mirrored by the above part.
* [1x20 socket, stackable header](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/samtec-inc/SSQ-120-03-T-S/SAM1206-20-ND/1111938)
	- This extends one side of the Pi header directly to the breadboard.

The most convenient arrangement for a Raspberry Pi Zero is to use right a right angle header so that the Pi can plug directly to the Pi Spade vertically.
